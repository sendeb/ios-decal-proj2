## HangMan
In Project 2, I made an iOS Hangman game. A user can start a game, make guesses for a phrase (list of phrases provided), see their progresses toward the phrase, see a list of previously guessed, incorrect letters, see how many guesses they have left (indicated by a hangman image), be alerted of a win or loss, and start a new game.
