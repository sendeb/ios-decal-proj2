## Description 
In Project 2, you are going to make an iOS Hangman game. A user should be able to start a game, make guesses for a phrase (list of phrases provided), see their progresses toward the phrase, see a list of previously guessed, incorrect letters, see how many guesses they have left (indicated by a hangman image; basic images provided), be alerted of a win or loss, and start a new game.
